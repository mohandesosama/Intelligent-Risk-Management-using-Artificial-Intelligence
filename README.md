## Abstract
Effective information security risk management is essential for survival of any business that is dependent on IT. In this paper we present an efficient and effective solution to find best parameters for managing cyber risks using artificial intelligence. Genetic algorithm is use as it can provide our required optimization and intelligence. Results show that GA is professional in finding the best parameters and minimizing the risk.

## INTRODUCTION
Emerging technologies has transformed the business era. That transformation has multiplied the number of cyber-attacks. Risk management is playing pivotal role in ensuring organizations continue to survive in today competitive market. Organizations are investing huge amount for protection from cyber-attacks and making their systems secured. In the fast-paced IT world business often focus extensively on their profit serving processes resulting in losing sight of emerging risks. Risk Management itself is a time taking process that requires frequent monitoring and excellent expertise for efficient execution. In large and medium sized organizations, the scope of risk management is enormous. The ever-growing dependency of business processes on IT systems as resulted in growing threats that result in significant risks which have the capability to hamper any business activity at any time. Importance of risk management is also emphasized by growing number of information security standards and stringent government regulations like HIPPA, GDPR, NESA and SAMA CSF etc.
Artificial intelligence is providing answers to problems that were previously unanswered or had cumbersome solutions. Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that emphasizes the development of computer systems that can think logically through reasoning, are adaptable to changing environment and can evolve over time.

Genetic algorithm (GA) approach was selected taking into consideration its efficiency while solving tasks with large solution space and ability to model the evolution process which is the case for risk management multiple scenarios, often considered as a form of artificial life, evolution forecasting. 
The proposed algorithm considers the GA as a third-party tool to help risk analyst to get the best parameters that minimizes risk. The proposed algorithm starts by calculating risk manually. If the analyst is not satisfied by the result, he/she will use GA to find the best parameters that minimizes the risk. 
This paper is divided into several sections. The related work is discussed in section 2 along with brief of relevant research. Section 3 discuss the background of our research and established our platform. In section 4 we present our hybrid design and its working methodology. Section 5 elaborates how it is implemented and the deliverables.

## THE PROPOSED APPROACH
Prior to explanation of design presented in this paper it is mandatory to understand the key advantage of the proposed design.
As shown in Figure 2, the presented design takes various risk assessment values as genetic algorithm variables and after processing deliver parameters that are essential for maintaining risks under control in any type of business environment.
Risk assessment exercise is performed to get information that can be use as input for genetic algorithm.
